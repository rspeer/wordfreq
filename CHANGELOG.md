## Version 2.4 (2020-10-01)

- The Exquisite Corpus data has been updated to include Google Books Ngrams
  2019, Reddit data through 2019, Wikipedia data from 2020, and Twitter-sampled
  data from 2020, and somewhat more reliable language detection.

- Updated dependencies to require recent versions of `regex` and `jieba`,
  to get tokenization that's consistent with the word lists. `regex` now
  requires a version after 2020.04.04.

- Added more vowels (including `œ` and `y`) to the regular expression that
  splits letter-and-apostrophe strings from tokens that start with vowels
  in French and Catalan.

## Version 2.3.2 (2020-04-28)

- Relaxing the dependency on regex had an unintended consequence in 2.3.1:
  it could no longer get the frequency of French phrases such as "l'écran"
  because their tokenization behavior changed.

  2.3.2 fixes this with a more complex tokenization rule that should handle
  apostrophes the same across these various versions of regex.

## Version 2.3.1 (2020-04-22)

- State the dependency on msgpack >= 1.0 in setup.py.
- Relax the dependency on regex to allow versions after 2018.02.08.

## Version 2.3 (2020-04-16)

- Python 3.5 is the oldest maintained version of Python, and we have stopped
  claiming support for earlier versions.

- Updated to langcodes 2.0.

- Deprecated the `match_cutoff` parameter, which was intended for situations
  where we need to approximately match a language code, but was not usefully
  configurable in those situations.

## Version 2.2.2 (2020-02-28)

Library change:

- Fixed an incompatibility with newly-released `msgpack 1.0`.

## Version 2.2.1 (2019-02-05)

Library changes:

- Relaxed the version requirement on the 'regex' dependency, allowing
  compatibility with spaCy.

  The range of regex versions that wordfreq now allows is from 2017.07.11 to
  2018.02.21. No changes to word boundary matching were made between these
  versions.

- Fixed calling `msgpack.load` with a deprecated parameter.


## Version 2.2 (2018-07-24)

Library change:

- While the @ sign is usually considered a symbol and not part of a word, there
  is a case where it acts like a letter. It's used in one way of writing
  gender-neutral words in Spanish and Portuguese, such as "l@s niñ@s". The
  tokenizer in wordfreq will now allow words to end with "@" or "@s", so it
  can recognize these words.

Data changes:

- Updated the data from Exquisite Corpus to filter the ParaCrawl web crawl
  better. ParaCrawl provides two metrics (Zipporah and Bicleaner) for the
  goodness of its data, and we now filter it to only use texts that get
  positive scores on both metrics.

- The input data includes the change to tokenization described above, giving
  us word frequencies for words such as "l@s".


## Version 2.1 (2018-06-18)

Data changes:

- Updated to the data from the latest Exquisite Corpus, which adds the
  ParaCrawl web crawl and updates to OpenSubtitles 2018
- Added small word list for Latvian
- Added large word list for Czech
- The Dutch large word list once again has 5 data sources

Library changes:

- The output of `word_frequency` is rounded to three significant digits. This
  provides friendlier output, and better reflects the precision of the
  underlying data anyway.

- The MeCab interface can now look for Korean and Japanese dictionaries
  in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mecab`, which is where Ubuntu 18.04 puts them
  when they are installed from source.


## Version 2.0.1 (2018-05-01)

Fixed edge cases that inserted spurious token boundaries when Japanese text is
run through `simple_tokenize`, because of a few characters that don't match any
of our "spaceless scripts".

It is not a typical situation for Japanese text to be passed through
`simple_tokenize`, because Japanese text should instead use the
Japanese-specific tokenization in `wordfreq.mecab`.

However, some downstream uses of wordfreq have justifiable reasons to pass all
terms through `simple_tokenize`, even terms that may be in Japanese, and in
those cases we want to detect only the most obvious token boundaries.

In this situation, we no longer try to detect script changes, such as between
kanji and katakana, as token boundaries. This particularly allows us to keep
together Japanese words where ヶ appears between kanji, as well as words that
use the iteration mark 々.

This change does not affect any word frequencies. (The Japanese word list uses
`wordfreq.mecab` for tokenization, not `simple_tokenize`.)



## Version 2.0 (2018-03-14)

The big change in this version is that text preprocessing, tokenization, and
postprocessing to look up words in a list are separate steps.

If all you need is preprocessing to make text more consistent, use
`wordfreq.preprocess.preprocess_text(text, lang)`. If you need preprocessing
and tokenization, use `wordfreq.tokenize(text, lang)` as before. If you need
all three steps, use the new function `wordfreq.lossy_tokenize(text, lang)`.

As a breaking change, this means that the `tokenize` function no longer has
the `combine_numbers` option, because that's a postprocessing step. For
the same behavior, use `lossy_tokenize`, which always combines numbers.

Similarly, `tokenize` will no longer replace Chinese characters with their
Simplified Chinese version, while `lossy_tokenize` will.

Other changes:

- There's a new default wordlist for each language, called "best". This
  chooses the "large" wordlist for that language, or if that list doesn't
  exist, it falls back on "small".

- The wordlist formerly named "combined" (this name made sense long ago)
  is now named "small". "combined" remains as a deprecated alias.

- The "twitter" wordlist has been removed. If you need to compare word
  frequencies from individual sources, you can work with the separate files in
  [exquisite-corpus][].

- Tokenizing Chinese will preserve the original characters, no matter whether
  they are Simplified or Traditional, instead of replacing them all with
  Simplified characters.

- Different languages require different processing steps, and the decisions
  about what these steps are now appear in the `wordfreq.language_info` module,
  replacing a bunch of scattered and inconsistent `if` statements.

- Tokenizing CJK languages while preserving punctuation now has a less confusing
  implementation.

- The preprocessing step can transliterate Azerbaijani, although we don't yet
  have wordlists in this language. This is similar to how the tokenizer
  supports many more languages than the ones with wordlists, making future
  wordlists possible.

- Speaking of that, the tokenizer will log a warning (once) if you ask to tokenize
  text written in a script we can't tokenize (such as Thai).

- New source data from [exquisite-corpus][] includes OPUS OpenSubtitles 2018.

Nitty gritty dependency changes:

- Updated the regex dependency to 2018.02.21. (We would love suggestions on
  how to coexist with other libraries that use other versions of `regex`,
  without a `>=` requirement that could introduce unexpected data-altering
  changes.)

- We now depend on `msgpack`, the new name for `msgpack-python`.

  complex emoji introduced in Unicode 10

- Remove some non-words, such as the Unicode replacement character and the
  pilcrow sign, from frequency lists

  source data to be included


## Version 1.6.1 (2017-05-10)

- Depend on langcodes 1.4, with a new language-matching system that does not
  depend on SQLite.

  preventing langcodes from being used in threads.

- Expand language detection on Reddit to cover 13 languages with large enough
  Reddit communities
- Drop the Common Crawl; we have enough good sources now that we don't have

- Adjust tokenization of apostrophes next to vowel sounds: the French word
  "l'heure" is now tokenized similarly to "l'arc"
- Multi-digit numbers of each length are smashed into the same word frequency,
  to remove meaningless differences and increase compatibility with word2vec.
  (Internally, their digits are replaced by zeroes.)
- Another new frequency-merging strategy (drop the highest and lowest,
  average the rest)


## Version 1.5.1 (2016-08-19)

  other one is not available

- Support Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian,
  Norwegian Bokmål, and Romanian
- Improve Korean with MeCab tokenization

- Include Wikipedia as a Chinese source (mostly Traditional)
- Include Reddit as a Spanish source
- Remove Greek Twitter because its data is poorly language-detected
- Add large lists in Arabic, Dutch, Italian
- Remove marks from more languages
- Deal with commas and cedillas in Turkish and Romanian

  Traditional Chinese characters to Simplified
- Improve Greek
- Add Polish, Swedish, and Turkish
- Tokenizer can optionally preserve punctuation
- Detect when sources stripped "'t" off of English words, and repair their
  frequencies

## Version 1.1 (2015-08-25)

- Use the 'regex' package to implement Unicode tokenization that's mostly
  consistent across languages
