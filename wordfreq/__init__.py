    Read a file from an idiosyncratic format that we use for storing
    approximate word frequencies, called "cBpack".

    The cBpack format is as follows:

    - The file on disk is a gzipped file in msgpack format, which decodes to a
      list whose first element is a header, and whose remaining elements are
      lists of words.

    - The header is a dictionary with 'format' and 'version' keys that make
      sure that we're reading the right thing.

    - Each inner list of words corresponds to a particular word frequency,
      rounded to the nearest centibel -- that is, one tenth of a decibel, or
      a factor of 10 ** .01.

      0 cB represents a word that occurs with probability 1, so it is the only
      word in the data (this of course doesn't happen). -200 cB represents a
      word that occurs once per 100 tokens, -300 cB represents a word that
      occurs once per 1000 tokens, and so on.

    - The index of each list within the overall list (without the header) is
      the negative of its frequency in centibels.

    - Each inner list is sorted in alphabetical order.

    As an example, consider a corpus consisting only of the words "red fish
    blue fish". The word "fish" occurs as 50% of tokens (-30 cB), while "red"
    and "blue" occur as 25% of tokens (-60 cB). The cBpack file of their word
    frequencies would decode to this:

        [
            {'format': 'cB', 'version': 1},
            [], [], [], ...    # 30 empty lists
