    # Case 1: a special case for non-spaced languages
    # -----------------------------------------------

    # Some scripts are written without spaces, and the Unicode algorithm
    # seems to overreact and insert word breaks between all their letters.
    # When we see sequences of characters in these scripts, we make sure not
    # to break them up. Such scripts include Han ideographs (\p{IsIdeo}),
    # hiragana (\p{Script=Hiragana}), and many Southeast Asian scripts such
    # as Thai and Khmer.
    #
    # Without this case, the standard rule (case 2) would make each character
    # a separate token. This would be the correct behavior for word-wrapping,
    # but a messy failure mode for NLP tokenization.
    #
    # If you have Chinese or Japanese text, it's certainly better to use a
    # tokenizer that's designed for it. Elsewhere in this file, we have
    # specific tokenizers that can handle Chinese and Japanese. With this
    # rule, though, at least this general tokenizer will fail less badly
    # on those languages.
    #
    # This rule is listed first so that it takes precedence. The placeholder
    # <SPACELESS> will be replaced by the complex range expression made by
    # _make_spaceless_expr().

    [<SPACELESS>]+
    |

    # Case 2: Gender-neutral "@s"
    # ---------------------------
    #
    # "@" and "@s" are gender-neutral word endings that can replace -a, -o,
    # -as, and -os in Spanish, Portuguese, and occasionally Italian.
    #
    # This doesn't really conflict with other uses of the @ sign, so we simply
    # recognize these endings as being part of the token in any language.
    #
    # We will recognize the endings as part of our main rule for recognizing
    # words, which is Case 3 below. However, one case that remains separate is
    # the Portuguese word "@s" itself, standing for the article "as" or "os".
    # This must be followed by a word break (\b).

    @s \b
    |

    # Case 3: Unicode segmentation with tweaks
    # ----------------------------------------

    # The start of the token must be 'word-like', not punctuation or whitespace
    # or various other things. However, we allow characters of category So
    # (Symbol - Other) because many of these are emoji, which can convey
    # meaning.

    (?=[\w\p{So}])

    # The start of the token must not consist of 1-2 letters, an apostrophe,
    # and a vowel or 'h'. This is a sequence that occurs particularly in French
    # phrases such as "l'arc", "d'heure", or "qu'un". In these cases we want
    # the sequence up to the apostrophe to be considered as a separate token,
    # even though apostrophes are not usually word separators (the word "won't"
    # does not separate into "won" and "t").
    #
    # This would be taken care of by optional rule "WB5a" in Unicode TR29,
    # "Unicode Text Segmentation". That optional rule was applied in `regex`
    # before June 2018, but no longer is, so we have to do it ourselves.

    (?!\w\w?'<VOWEL>)

    # The entire token is made of graphemes (\X). Matching by graphemes means
    # that we don't have to specially account for marks or ZWJ sequences. We
    # use a non-greedy match so that we can control where the match ends in the
    # following expression.
    #
    # If we were matching by codepoints (.) instead of graphemes (\X), then
    # detecting boundaries would be more difficult. Here's a fact about the
    # regex module that's subtle and poorly documented: a position that's
    # between codepoints, but in the middle of a grapheme, does not match as a
    # word break (\b), but also does not match as not-a-word-break (\B). The
    # word boundary algorithm simply doesn't apply in such a position. It is
    # unclear whether this is intentional.

    \X+?

    # The token ends when it encounters a word break (\b). We use the
    # non-greedy match (+?) to make sure to end at the first word break we
    # encounter.
    #
    # We need a special case for gender-neutral "@", which is acting as a
    # letter, but Unicode considers it to be a symbol and would break words
    # around it.  We prefer continuing the token with "@" or "@s" over matching
    # a word break.
    #
    # As in case 2, this is only allowed at the end of the word. Unfortunately,
    # we can't use the word-break expression \b in this case, because "@"
    # already is a word break according to Unicode. Instead, we use a negative
    # lookahead assertion to ensure that the next character is not word-like.
    (?:
       @s? (?!\w) | \b
    )
    |

    # Another subtle fact: the "non-breaking space" U+A0 counts as a word break
    # here. That's surprising, but it's also what we want, because we don't want
    # any kind of spaces in the middle of our tokens.

    # Case 4: Match French apostrophes
    # --------------------------------
    # This allows us to match the particles in French, Catalan, and related
    # languages, such as «l'» and «qu'», that we may have excluded from being
    # part of the token in Case 3.

    It makes sure not to split in the middle of a grapheme, so that zero-width
    joiners and marks on Devanagari words work correctly.

    Our customizations to the expression are:

    - It leaves sequences of Chinese or Japanese characters (specifically, Han
      ideograms and hiragana) relatively untokenized, instead of splitting each
      character into its own token.

    - If `include_punctuation` is False (the default), it outputs only the
      tokens that start with a word-like character, or miscellaneous symbols
      such as emoji. If `include_punctuation` is True, it outputs all non-space
      tokens.

    - It keeps Southeast Asian scripts, such as Thai, glued together. This yields

    CJK scripts
    -----------

    In the CJK languages, word boundaries can't usually be identified by a
    regular expression. Instead, there needs to be some language-specific
    handling. In Chinese, we use the Jieba tokenizer, with a custom word list
    to match the words whose frequencies we can look up. In Japanese and
    Korean, we use the MeCab tokenizer.

    The `external_wordlist` option only affects Chinese tokenization.  If it's
    True, then wordfreq will not use its own Chinese wordlist for tokenization.
    Instead, it will use the large wordlist packaged with the Jieba tokenizer,
    and it will leave Traditional Chinese characters as is. This will probably
    give more accurate tokenization, but the resulting tokens won't necessarily
    have word frequencies that can be looked up.

    If you end up seeing tokens that are entire phrases or sentences glued
    together, that probably means you passed in CJK text with the wrong
