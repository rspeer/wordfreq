# This defines the rules on how to build parts of the wordfreq lists, using the
# Ninja build system:
#
#   http://martine.github.io/ninja/manual.html
#
# Ninja is available in the 'ninja-build' Ubuntu package. It's like make with
# better parallelism and the ability for build steps to produce multiple
# outputs. The tradeoff is that its rule syntax isn't full of magic for
# expanding wildcards and finding dependencies, so in general you have to
# write the dependencies using a script.
#
# This file will become the header of the larger build.ninja file, which also
# contains the programatically-defined dependency graph.

# Variables

# How to build the build.ninja file itself. (Use the Makefile to get it the
# first time.)

# To convert the Leeds corpus, look for space-separated lines that start with
